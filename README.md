# BlockchainEDU

This is a blockchain project that can be used by students and teachers to manage the assignments of a course.
Assignments can be added and removed from the frontend which simultaneously adds or removes the assignment from
the blockchain. 

In order to spin up the application, you will need to start by downloading the code onto your local machine.
Next, install the dependencies in package.json but running the 'npm install' command. Then, if you run the command
'npm run dev' the functioning web app will open in google chrome.
